# Funding Goals Across Campaigns

## Overview of Project

This project will analyze the funding goals of multiple theater campaigns and their relationship. 
### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to determine the outcome of different campaigns based on their funding goals.
To complete this analysis I specifically looked at theater to offer comparisons with Fever.
I created a pivot table that would highglight how many theater campaigns were successful, failed and were canceled.
This pivot was filtered by "year" and by category. The pivot took the data and created a table of count of these outcomes across different months. I then created a line graph to display this data.
### [Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date](file:///C:/Users/angel/Downloads/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
When analyzing the line graph of the data, we see a spike in success around May. This make sense April through August are typically warmer months due to summer. Individuals may be more likely to attend a play or some sort of theater presentation in warmer weather. There was also a slight increase in failures but this was not significant due to the proportions with respect to other areas of the graph. It seems that a theater projcect may have more success reaching it's funding goal if it occurs during the summer months particularly in May.
### [Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals](file:///C:/Users/angel/Downloads/Resources/Outcomes%20vs%20Goals.png)
When analyzing the graph, we see that having a goal of less than $15000 for a play may increase the change of successfully meeting that goal. Theree is also a chance of succe with a goal from 35000 to 44999. A play may be less likely to draw in a large crowd especially depending on ticket prices. We can assume that a smaller goal is the best chance of success.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There were no real difficulties with providing this analysis. The primary difficulty came from trying to think of ways to more efficiently manipulate the data. It was tedious to copy certain pieces of data. I will make sure to ask next time when moving thorugh my next challenge.
## Results
Overall, if one analyzes the data of "Outcomes based on Launch Date" you can see that the summer season is the best time to have a theater project. The winter season is the worst time. This is due to the success and failure rates in these portions of time.
From the "Outcomes based on Goals" graph, we can see that having a more conservative goal offers a better chance of success. Success can be found with a high goal but there is a significantly higher chance of failure. If one wants to meet a high funding goal, the best chance of that is to have the play in the month of May. There are limitations to this dataset. We specifically looked at theater campaigns, and then looked narrower at only plays. This data doesnt represent other formats of entertainment. We also didnt necessarily define what it means to be successful or a failure. We couldv'e created a scatter plot to show special cases or outliers when looking at this dataset. Some results couldv'e skewed the data presented.
